Pizza Menu:
This project is an example menu for a pizza restaurant, in which the user can-
 chose from a list of pizza sizes, meat toppings, and vegetable toppings. 
 The program takes the input information and calculates and displays a price on the screen for the user.

Tic-Tac-Toe Game:
This project is a classic game of tic-tac-toe. The user plays against the computer, and sound effects play-
based on what is happening in the game. After either the computer or the user wins/ties, the game automatically-
resets and the computer places its first move.

This project is a basic calculator, with the following abilities: multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.
